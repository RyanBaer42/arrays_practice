#How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?

I feel very confident, fortunately I've had prior experience with arrays and this served as a nice practice session to make sure I still knew what i was doing.

#Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?

As far as the basics go I feel pretty confident. The one method array method I have very little experience with is .slice so I will definitely be practicing it in replit

#What questions do you have about Arrays?

The one question that comes to mind is why not use different data types in the same array. I feel like it would be a beneficial way to store multiple types of information about a single person/object.
